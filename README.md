## 1. [TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game](https://github.com/ragibayon/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Python/TV%2C%20Halftime%20Shows%2C%20and%20the%20Big%20Game/TV%2C%20halftime%20shows%2C%20and%20the%20Big%20Game.ipynb)

Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy in the games themselves. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes riding giant mechanical tigers or leaping from the roof of the stadium. And in this project, I have tried to find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. I have answered questions like:

* What are the most extreme game outcomes?
* How does the game affect television viewership?
* How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
* Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

> The dataset used in this project was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files, one with [game data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ragibayon/Data-Science-Projects/master/Python/TV%2C%20Halftime%20Shows%2C%20and%20the%20Big%20Game/datasets/tv.csv), one with [TV data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ragibayon/Data-Science-Projects/master/Python/TV%2C%20Halftime%20Shows%2C%20and%20the%20Big%20Game/datasets/tv.csv), and one with [halftime musician data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ragibayon/Data-Science-Projects/master/Python/TV%2C%20Halftime%20Shows%2C%20and%20the%20Big%20Game/datasets/halftime_musicians.csv) for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.

## 2. [The Android App Market on Google Play](https://github.com/ragibayon/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Python/The%20Android%20App%20Market%20on%20Google%20Play/The%20Android%20App%20Market%20on%20Google%20Play.ipynb)

Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. With more than 1 billion active users in 190 countries around the world, Google Play continues to be an important distribution platform to build a global audience. In this project, I have done a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. I have looked for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention, and mined user review data to determine how people feel about a product, brand, or service using a technique called sentiment analysis.

In this project I have tried to find answers for these following questions using a data driven approach.

* Which category has the highest share of (active) apps in the market?
  * Is any specific category dominating the market?
  * Which categories have the fewest number of apps?

* How can we effectively come up with strategies to size and price our app?
  * Does the size of an app affect its rating?
  * Do users really care about system-heavy apps or do they prefer light-weighted apps?
  * Does the price of an app affect its rating?
  * Do users always prefer free apps over paid apps?

> The dataset used in this project is made up of two CSV files, one with [apps.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ragibayon/Data-Science-Projects/master/Python/The%20Android%20App%20Market%20on%20Google%20Play/datasets/apps.csv) which contains all the details of the applications on Google Play. There are 13 features that describe a given app. and one with [user_reviews.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ragibayon/Data-Science-Projects/master/Python/The%20Android%20App%20Market%20on%20Google%20Play/datasets/user_reviews.csv) which contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first. The text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three new features: Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.
